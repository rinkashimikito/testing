## TODO:

* reducer composition (during the development the code will evolve and grow so it would be good to create separate reducers at some point; for this simple example it's debatable)
* normalise state (same thing)
* use selectors (for normalised state handling)
* based on the app arch make more 'dumb' components / use 'containers'
* update tests (?)
* css pre/post processing, minification, concatenation etc.
* ...
* add some styles (doesn't look great, does it? ;))
* add caching for filtering (for longer todo lists switching back and forth between two filters could unnecessarily become expensive)
